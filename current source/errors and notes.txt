Error: Server execution failed trying to create outlook object

This same error was happening to me.  The problem was because I was running Visual Studio as an Administrator.  
Changing Outlook to run as admin, or changing VS to not run as admin fixed the problem.

To get the “old style” menu back which you got when right clicking an item on the Taskbar, 
you must now press and hold the SHIFT button on your keyboard when right clicking the item.

Another method in Windows 7 to start an application as administrator but without opening the 
classic right click menu first is to hold CTRL+SHIFT when clicking on the Outlook icon
